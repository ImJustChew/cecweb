                </div>
                <div class="description-desc-text">
                  With the help of Laser Printer, Heat Press Machine, Ferric Chloride and Acetone. PCB etching can be done easily. First, print out the PCB design on the transfer paper. Then, clean the copper board with acetone and put it onto the Heat Press Machine, the toner will be transferred to the copper board. After that, remove the paper and put it into the ferric chloride until all the copper has dissolved around the design. Once All the Copper Is Gone Rinse It in the Water Bath, Let It Dry and Use Acetone to Whip Off the Ink Transferred Onto the PCB and the PCB Etching process is done!

				CEC provide laptops for students to access information as well as digital tools to design, create, and collaborate on projects, such as program robots and use other programming tools. We also have a laser printer to produce patterns, designs, decorations, and explanatory materials. Along with Internet access, computers offer access to reference information, project ideas, expert help, instructional videos and safety information as well as data files to modify or replicate with digital fabrication tools. Documenting and sharing projects is an important part of making, this is where the server comes into play, it simplifies the management of laptops and file collaboration, and also act as the security gateway for all computers that are connected to CEC's network.
