                <div class="description-desc-text">
                  With the help of Laser Printer, Heat Press Machine, Ferric Chloride and Acetone. PCB etching can be done easily. First, print out the PCB design on the transfer paper. Then, clean the copper board with acetone and put it onto the Heat Press Machine, the toner will be transferred to the copper board. After that, remove the paper and put it into the ferric chloride until all the copper has dissolved around the design. Once All the Copper Is Gone Rinse It in the Water Bath, Let It Dry and Use Acetone to Whip Off the Ink Transferred Onto the PCB and the PCB Etching process is done!
