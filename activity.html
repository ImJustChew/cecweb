                </div>
                <div class="description-desc-text">
                 Lesson 0 focus on the fundamentals of electronics while lesson 1 focus on more complex circuits. In the era of Artificial Intelligence, CEC strongly encourage an open-minded approach towards students’ learning process, CEC emphasizes mostly on practical lessons, for instance, by exposing students to a variety of circuits, students can understand the characteristics of each unique components. This enables students to discover the world of electronics and work as a team to develop a project, this enables students to develop Problem Solving, Critical Thinking and Teamworking skills, so that students are well prepared to face the entangled world. On the other hand, CEC always discouraging traditional teaching method, which is 100% theory and 0% practical.

                <div class="description-desc-text">
                  Power Supply Project is an entry-level project for every form 1 students, it’s also an all-in-one project, a combination of Laser Cutting, 3D Printing, Woodworking, PCB Etching and Soldering. Students also can gain knowledge of Transformer Voltage Step Down, Rectification Process, Capacitor Charge/Discharge Properties and AC/DC Power Characteristics as well. This Project will be used as a power source for students future projects such as Mini Hand Drill Project.

                <div class="description-desc-text">
                  Maker Class is an additional class which held in every Saturday, its main purpose is for students who are highly interested in electronics to learn & create Arduino Projects, Develop Android App, Construct School & Competition Projects. Teaching these programmes to students is extremely hard, special thanks to our coach Mr Kang, who is willing to spend his time & effort on this class, which help students a lot because everything literally starts from zero. Our latest projects include the RGB Hall Clock, Wearable Message Display for traffic control, Car Speed & Weight Balance Project for science lab and a lot more.

                  “The sky is the limit” that’s what our members believe, instead of competing with others, why not compete with ourselves? CEC provides many golden opportunities for our members to take part in the competitions and exhibitions. It’s not all about winning awards and prize money, most importantly join the community of makers, using our small ideas to make the world a better place.
